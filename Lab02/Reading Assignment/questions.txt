Java doesn't allow you to create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a
constructor method to build a DVD by category because there's only one argument in both case.
When you create a new DVD instance with only one argument passed, the system will not know whether
the argument is the title or the category. Therefore Java forbids the creation of such constructors.

TL;DR: No.
