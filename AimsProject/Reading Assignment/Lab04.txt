QUESTION: Iterate through the list and print out the information of the media by using toString() method. Observe
what happens and explain in detail. 
ANSWER: The console prints out different kinds of information for different types of media because the parent class
(Media) has overridden toString() method from Object class, the children classes (CompactDisc, DigitalVideoDisc, Book) have 
then overridden the toString() method (getDetails() method in my case) from the class Media to match their data.
