QUESTION 1: Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of
arguments for dvd. Compare to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?
ANSWER: I do prefer the method that allows to pass an arbirary number of arguments for dvd
since I can pass the dvds directly as arguments instead of creating an array of the dvds and then pass it.


QUESTION 2: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two
objects still remain?
ANSWER: Because two temporary objects are created to copy jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD and then are passed
to the method. They are only references to the actual data stored in the memory.
The two temporary objects are swapped but the original ones still refer to their original objects data.


QUESTION 3: After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is
the title of the JungleDVD changed?
ANSWER: When you pass jungleDVD to the method, a temporary object (we can call it dvd) is created and refer to the actual
data stored in the memory. But its attribute (dvd.title) can be changed so that both jungleDVD and dvd refer to the same
object but have their attribute title changed.


QUESTION 4: Write a getDetail() method for the DigitalVideoDisc class. What should be the return type of
this method?
ANSWER: The return type should be Object[], which is an array of objects of various types.
